Please note that this was one of the first projects I created. In further projects I incorporate functions and object oriented programming.

For this task we were tasked with creating a simple game. 
I created a simple shooter game. The user is required to shoot a certain amount of asteroids (in this case 3) before the user can claim the prize, winning the game.
